## Hi there 👋

I'm Cynthia, I started my journey studying <strong>Business Administration at UNAM</strong> in Mexico — one of the largest universities in the world — where I learned to think strategically about organizations and people. <br><br>
          Curiosity has always been my default setting. I want to understand the reason behind everything — why a market shifts, why a metric drops, why people behave the way they do. Analytics felt like a natural fit because it's basically a structured way to be endlessly curious about how businesses really work.<br><br>
          Now I'm in Canada levelling up with a <strong>Master's in Management Analytics at Queen's University</strong>, pairing strategic thinking with solid data know-how.
